#
# This is a Makefile.am fragment to build Orc code. It is based
# on the orc.mak file distributed in the GStreamer common
# repository.
#
# Include this file like this:
#
#  include $(top_srcdir)/orc.mak
#
# For each Orc source file, append its name (without the extension)
# to ORC_SOURCE:
#
#  ORC_SOURCE += gstadderorc
#
# This will create gstadder-orc-gen.c and gstadder-orc-gen.h, which
# you need to add to your nodist_module_SOURCES.
#
# Note that this file appends to BUILT_SOURCES and CLEANFILES, so
# define them before including this file.
#
